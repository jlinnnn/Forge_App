Goal: The goal of this exercise is to see how well you work with a basic dataset and how you approach data analysis and visualization. You will pick a dataset, clean it if necessary, and then build a story using basic manipulation and visualization to present on insights gleaned

include data-cleaning, data-collection, eda

1) Pick a dataset
   1) a lil messy 
2) Explore and analyze the dataset
3) Create a story with your findings
   1) Now that you've cleaned and explored your dataset, what stands out? What does the data reveal about the topic? You should be able to walk us through the questions you wanted to answer with this data and what you ultimately discovered.

Create a slide deck presentation to walk us through your process & present your findings and visualizations. Consider including:
- Why did you choose this dataset? What interested you about it, and what questions did you hope to explore?
- What was your approach to analyzing and visualizing this dataset? What did you try firstâ€”what worked, and what didn't?
- Numbers and charts displaying your key findings, and explanations of how they answer your initial questions.
- What else would you investigate or visualize with this data if you had more time? 
- Was there anything you wanted to do but couldn't quite pull off - if so, tell us about it.
